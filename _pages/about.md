I am a 4-th-year PhD student in Statistics at [Rice University](https://statistics.rice.edu/), advised by [Dr. Eric Chi](https://www.ericchi.com/) (now at University of Minnesota) and [Dr. Hengrui Luo](https://hrluo.github.io/HengruiLuo_Home.html). Before joining Rice, I graduated from [UC - Santa Barbara](https://www.pstat.ucsb.edu/) in 2022 with a major in Financial Math and Statistics (highest honor at graduation). 

My expertise lies in building and implementing advanced statistical models and studying machine learning method and theory. I am currently working on projects about robust estimation, tensor regression, and transfer learning, and I am broadly interested in machine learning, computational statistics, covex optimization, high-dimensional statistics, and Bayesian surrogate modelling, and their applications in various fields, such as physics, biology, and public health.

Outside of research, I love travelling, hiking, and soccer. I am also an (acoustic) guitar soloist.
